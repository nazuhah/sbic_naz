	<p>A response based on our standard data search service includes information on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Statutory and non-statutory site designations (i.e. sites of regional/local importance including Ancient woodland (our response will include information on their name, their location and the basis for their designation)</li>
		<li>Protected species</li>
		<li>Rare/notable species</li>
		<li>Priority Species/Species of Conservation Concern as identified in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If you would like us to undertake a data search for you please email the following details to us:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A grid reference or map, showing a site boundary, for the centre of the desired search area.</li>
		<li>The size/radius of the desired search area. </li>
		<li>Company details, or for non-commercial enquiries an indication of what the information will be used for.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Charges will be applied based on the amount of time needed to complete the report. Charges will not normally be applied to requests received from schools/colleges and members of the public.</p>
